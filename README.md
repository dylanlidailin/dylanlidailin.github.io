# Charlottesville Bus System
This research investigates the difference in bus ridership between UVA-affiliated and non-UVA-affiliated buses in Charlottesville using data from the City of Charlottesville Open Data portal. Two key questions are addressed: **What is the busiest hour for each group**, and **what are the busiest areas**.
