  <h1>Animated Histogram</h1>
  <p>The histogram exhibits a bimodal distribution, with two distinct clusters of ridership. A smaller cluster appears in the early morning hours (roughly 0–5), while a more pronounced cluster occurs in the late afternoon to evening (approximately 13–23), with the maximum average ridership peaking around 21:00 (9 PM). There is a noticeable gap between these clusters, particularly from 6 to 12, indicating very low ridership during these hours. Within each cluster, the distribution appears to be right-skewed, with the early morning cluster tapering off and the evening cluster showing a gradual rise to the peak followed by a sharp decline. Overall, these statistical features suggest that the data is best characterized by two distinct ridership waves rather than a single unimodal pattern.</p>
